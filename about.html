                <p>Hello! I'm Known, the creator of this page. I'm passionate about technology and enjoy sharing insights, tutorials, and the latest trends in the tech world.</p>
                
                <div class="interests">
                    <h3>My Journey / What I Do</h3>
                    <p>My experience as a web developer gave me a strong foundation in secure coding techniques and the value of protecting user data, which paved the way for my entry into the field of cybersecurity. I've learned from my work experience at a financial institution how important it is to have strong security measures in place to safeguard private data.</p>
                    <p>I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, therefore I take up malware analysis as a hobby, investigating the potential of new harmful software on Android and Windows-based platforms. I can better grasp the changing strategies employed by cybercriminals thanks to this practical investigation, which also broadens my understanding of the threat landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>Along with analyzing malware, I like to experiment with Android variants, especially GrapheneOS, and I've gotten really good at rooting devices, including Samsung models with Knox. My knowledge of mobile security and the precautions required to shield devices from possible threats has increased as a result of this interest.</p>
                    <p>I actively participate in various Telegram channels focused on open-source intelligence (OSINT) and monitoring advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. This involvement helps me stay updated on the latest cybersecurity trends and threats.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I have amassed a collection of ransomware decryptors and leaked documents, which I study to explore the latest attack methodologies. My interest in research extends to reading papers on malware and generative AI, helping me to stay informed about advancements in the field.</p>
                    <p>As I look to further my career in cybersecurity, I am excited to leverage my diverse experiences and interests to contribute to creating secure digital environments and combating emerging threats.</p>
