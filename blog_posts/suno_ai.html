                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>An interesting find of a music generator tool that might put artists out of business? or a tool to help artists produce songs faster</p>
                    <h4>Who is this for?</h4>
                    <p>Interestingly you are not restricted specifically by visiting the site to check if you are above 18 or not but ToS states its aimed at 18+ audiences</p>
                    <figure class="image-container">
                        <img src="../assets/images/blog_posts/suno_ai/18_plus_advised_no_restriction.png" alt="18+" class="tutorial-image">
                        <figcaption>18 plus usage advised</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>There are many actions taken to avoid the usage of profanity but just as regular ChatGPT you can bypass it by similar sounding words, and the model will make the song in the same tone</p>
                    <h3>Paid Service vs Free</h3>
                    <p>The service limits you to 5 songs generated as a free user per day, but with the option to subscribe emphasizing still not unlimited, but token based music generation for 2000 songs for the lowest tier per Month</p>
                    <p>However do be aware that even though you can use the service for free the songs you make are owned by Suno, unless you subscribe.</p>
                    <figure class="image-container">
                        <img src="../assets/images/blog_posts/suno_ai/model_training_on_input_data.png" alt="training on your prompts" class="tutorial-image">
                        <figcaption>Your data is being trained on</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Without the ability to opt out of training on your data (which ChatGPT implemented as the Pause Option) we might be looking at an age when artists are no longer owning their songs, much like record labels.</p>
                    <h3>Labels vs AI</h3>
                    <p>We are already seeing big record labels suing SUNO and other AI music generators in fear of loosing rights and copyright <a class="links" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-music-generators-suno-and-udio-sued-for-copyright-infringement/">read more</a></p>
                    <p>Will big labels loose profits due to the hike in ai users? most probably, will it be an easy adoption? Certainly not.</p>
                    <p>But will artists support this move? There are certain members such as Timbaland that joined supporting suno, <a class="links" href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/suno-with-a-500m-valuation-has-admitted-training-its-ai-on-copyrighted-music-it-just-named-timbaland-as-a-strategic-advisor1/">read more</a></p>
                    <h3>Connections</h3>
                    <p>The company adheres to the US legal markets, and is funded by Daniel Gross as well, who helped Apple in Apple Intelligence. Being the highest investor in SUNO draws a line that SUNO will become more than what it is currently. </p>

                    <h3>So How Does it work?</h3>
                    <p>Account creation allows for using an Apple / Discord / Google or Microsoft Account, whit all of them being part of the Privacy Policy that using either of them you give up the personal information you have on those services, or you can use a phone number to sign up which has its own implications. There is currently no way to sign up using a simple email, so your best bet to try out the service is a disposable google account or microsoft account.</p>
                    <p>After logging in you are let loose to create any song with a prompt box similar to ChatGPT, type in anything and click generate lyrics.</p>
                    <p>But lyrics is not all that SUNO has to offer, you can set any style for the song you want to make, restrictions such as using names of artists are not allowed, but easily bypassed by different wording or enclosing the artists name in "[]" brackets.</p>
                    <p>Initial songs are generated at around 2minutes of length, but you CAN extend a song for 10 tokens to double it, this is what SUNO calls a full length song.</p>
                    <p>You can see how easily the tokens add up, for a free user.</p>

                    <p>While this practice is great for giving users a trial version, the dark patterns are present pressuring you to subscribe after you run out of tokens and multiple times being reminded that you COULD make covers / full songs / and OWN your songs you create.</p>
